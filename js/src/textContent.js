const challengeToSurvive = `The Amur tiger,also known as the Siberian Tiger, is the largest subspecies of tiger and lives in the snowy forests of the Russian Far East and China. They are one of the rarest cats remaining in the wild.
One-hundred years ago, there were an estimated 100,000 tigers in the wild. There are now fewer than 3200 tigers of all tiger species in the wild. Tigers have lost 93% of their habitat in the last century. Despite a long history of concern for tigers, wild tiger numbers are at a historic low.
The Amur Tiger is critically endangered. There are about 500 Amur tigers now left in the wild. The good news is that this is a growing number, up from an all time low of an estimated 300 thirty years ago, as conservation efforts are paying dividends. But there is still a long way to go to achieve sustainable populations and the tigers need your help!`

const disposableChopsticks = `While poaching and game hunting threatens tigers in other parts of the world, the biggest threat to Tigers in Eastern Russia is disposable chopsticks! Tiger habitat is being destroyed by both legal and illegal logging. Trees are harvested, shipped across the border to China, and then sold largely to Japan. Many are also
shipped to the US for use in Oriental themed restaurants. While tigers don't directly need trees to survive, their primary food source, the wild boar, need nut bearing trees to flourish.`

const trees4Tigers = `A collaborate partnership to create safe, sustainable habitats for people and tigers in Eastern Russia.`
